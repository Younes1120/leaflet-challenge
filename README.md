# Leaflet Earthquake Map Challenge

This project is an interactive dashboard that visualizes earthquake data using the Leaflet library. The data is provided by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and is plotted on a map based on the latitude and longitude coordinates. The markers on the map reflect the magnitude of the earthquakes through their size, and the depth of the earthquakes is represented by color. Additionally, the project includes popups that provide detailed information about each earthquake when a marker is clicked. A legend is also included to provide context for the map data.



## Technical Skills

To successfully complete this project, you should have the following technical skills:

- Basic knowledge of JavaScript
- Familiarity with the D3.js and Leaflet libraries
- Understanding of GeoJSON data format and APIs


## Project Requirements

In this project, you are required to:

- Retrieve earthquake data from the USGS GeoJSON feed
- Visualize the earthquakes on a Leaflet map
- Represent the magnitude of earthquakes using marker size
- Represent the depth of earthquakes using marker color
- Add popups to provide detailed information about each earthquake
- Create a legend to provide context for the map data
- Deploy the final project on a web hosting service (e.g., GitHub Pages)
